# CacheCleaner
Small extension for Google Chrome which removes all cached data

### TODO:
- Create an icon for the extension.
- Change state of the icon when clicked.
- ~~Find a way to make the extension start enabled and save the state.~~
- ~~Create an options page.~~
- Allow users to specify a set of URLs in which they wish to have the caching disabled for.
- ~~Allow users to specify what types of data they wish to have cleared as opposed
to just the cache.~~
